# Tripotanian War (Trablusgarp Savaşı) - 1911 *(Italy vs Ottoman Empire/Turkish-Italian War)*
### Reason
Italy provided its unification while France and England were controlling all undeveloped countries (England occupied Egypt in 1881, France occupied Algeria and Tunis. After Italy provided its unification, turned to **Tripoli -the last territory of Ottoman State in North Africa-** Tripoli was important for raw materials and it was good market place.
### What Happened
Italy occupied Tripoli, and the war began.
But Ottomans couldn’t interfere both from sea and land, because of the **blockade in Dardanelles**. **Mustafa Kemal and Ali Fethi** passed to Tripoli as volunteers and supported the Tripolitanian Public against Italians.
The war spreaded into a large area.
**During the war, Balkan countries combined against Ottoman State** and Ottoman was forced to request an armistice.
### In The End
Ousy (Uşi) Peace Agreement was signed between Italy and Ottoman State. According to this treaty; Ottoman state lost the ***last territory in North Africa***, Dodecanes (On İki Ada) and Rhodes were left to Italy temporary (until 1947).**

## 1st Balkan War
Balkan Countries attacked to Ottoman State, *Edirne and Kırklareli were occupied by Bulgaria*. At the end *Albania got its liberty*, *Agean Islands, Macedonia, East and West Thrace were lost*.
This defeat affected the **internal affairs of Ottoman State**; Committee of Union and Progress blamed the administration and in 1913 with a coup called Bab-ı Ali Baskını, Unionists got the power.

## 2nd Balkan War
- It started because of the Bulgarian expansion at the end of the first Balkan War so; the Balkan countries combined together against Bulgary.
- Ottoman State wanted  to use this opportunity in favour of itself.
- Bulgaria was defeated by Greece and Serbia
- Ottoman State got back **Edirne and Kırklareli**.

## As a result
*Between Ottoman and Bulgary: Istanbul Agreement*
*Between Ottoman and Greece: Athens Agreement were signed*
Unionists reinforced their power, **Turkism ideology rose** and **Ottomanism ended up**. - Especially because of the migrations from Balkans
